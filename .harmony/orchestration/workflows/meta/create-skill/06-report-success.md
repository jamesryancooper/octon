**Core:**
- `SKILL.md` — Main skill definition (ready for customization)

**References (progressive disclosure):**
- `references/phases.md` — Detailed phase behavior
- `references/io-contract.md` — Inputs, outputs, dependencies, command-line usage
- `references/safety.md` — Tool and file policies
- `references/examples.md` — Full usage examples
- `references/validation.md` — Acceptance criteria

**Directories:**

- `assets/` — For static resources

**Manifest updated:** `.harmony/capabilities/skills/manifest.yml`

### Next Steps

#### 1. Define the Skill

Edit `SKILL.md` to customize:

```yaml

description: >
  [Describe what this skill does and when to use it.
  Include keywords to help agents identify relevant tasks.]
---
```

Add:
- Clear description with keywords
- Core workflow phases
- Parameters table
- Output locations
- Boundaries and escalation triggers

#### 2. Add Reference Details

Edit reference files for progressive disclosure:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `references/phases.md` | Detailed step-by-step behavior |
| `references/io-contract.md` | Input/output schemas, command-line usage |
| `references/safety.md` | Tool permissions and file policies |
| `references/examples.md` | Full worked examples |
| `references/validation.md` | Acceptance criteria |

#### 3. Update Manifest and Registry

Edit `manifest.yml` and `registry.yml` to add:
- Human-readable `name` and `summary` (manifest)
- `status` and `tags` for filtering (manifest)
- `triggers` for natural language activation (manifest)
- `commands` and `requires.context` (registry)

#### 4. Test the Skill

```text
/<skill-name> [input]
```
