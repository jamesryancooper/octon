# Implementation-Grade Completeness Review

verdict: pass
unresolved_questions_count: 0
clarification_required: no

## Blockers

None for implementation-prompt readiness. Durable implementation remains out of
scope until a later lifecycle run dispatches this child through
`run-packet-implementation`.

## Assumptions

- `release_state` is `pre-1.0`.
- `change_profile` is `atomic`.
- The source text is fully mapped through `.octon/inputs/exploratory/proposals/architecture/proposal-program-runner-e2e-execution-program/resources/source-traceability-matrix.md`.
- This child owns only `tests, fixtures, negative controls, and validation coverage`.
- Existing route, validator, workflow, publication, registry, cleanup,
  closeout, archive, disclosure-tier, and run-control ownership is preserved.
- Parent program evidence may coordinate and summarize but never satisfies child
  receipts, promotion targets, validation verdicts, terminal outcomes, or
  archive metadata.

## Promotion Target Coverage

The manifest promotion targets are covered by the implementation plan and
review receipt:

- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/crates/kernel/tests/`
- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/crates/lifecycle_executor/tests/`
- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/tests/`
- `.octon/inputs/additive/extensions/octon-proposal-lifecycle/validation/tests/`
- `.octon/inputs/additive/extensions/octon-proposal-lifecycle/validation/scenarios/`

## Affected Artifact Coverage

Declared write scopes are bounded and reviewable:

- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/crates/kernel/tests/`
- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/crates/lifecycle_executor/tests/`
- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/tests/`
- `.octon/inputs/additive/extensions/octon-proposal-lifecycle/validation/tests/`
- `.octon/inputs/additive/extensions/octon-proposal-lifecycle/validation/scenarios/`

## Validator Coverage

- Run relevant Rust tests for lifecycle program controller and lifecycle executor adapter changes.
- Run proposal lifecycle validation shell tests and proposal validators.
- Run canonical publication and registry checks when authored-source changes require generated refresh.

## Implementation Prompt Readiness

Ready after strict proposal review authorization. The executable implementation
prompt must require post-implementation conformance and drift/churn receipts and
must refuse closeout or archive claims until both receipts pass.

## Exclusions

- Do not substitute implementation description for behavior tests.
- Do not claim coverage from generated snapshots without canonical source references.
- Do not close the program while required validator, review gate, child-readiness, or source-coverage checks fail.

## Final Route Recommendation

Proceed to `generate-packet-implementation-prompt`; do not implement or promote
this child during proposal-program creation.
