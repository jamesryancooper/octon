# Implementation Plan

1. Reconfirm child promotion targets and no-scope-widening constraints.
2. Refresh proposal review and strict pre-integration architecture review if required.
3. Generate a child executable implementation prompt in a later route.
4. Implement only the declared promotion targets.
5. Add regression tests and validators listed in this packet.
6. Retain child-owned implementation, conformance, drift/churn, and validation evidence.
7. Promote, close out, and archive only through child-owned lifecycle routes.
