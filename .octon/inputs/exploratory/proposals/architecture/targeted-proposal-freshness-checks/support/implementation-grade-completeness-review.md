# Implementation-Grade Completeness Review

## Blockers

None for proposal packet readiness. Durable implementation remains blocked until accepted review, strict architecture review, and explicit implementation authorization.

## Assumptions

The listed promotion targets are sufficient for the child goal. If implementation requires additional durable targets, route a child revision before implementation.

## Promotion Target Coverage

- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/scripts/validate-proposal-lifecycle-terminal-freshness.sh`
- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/scripts/generate-proposal-registry.sh`
- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/scripts/generate-proposal-artifact-index.sh`
- `.octon/inputs/additive/extensions/octon-proposal-lifecycle/context/lifecycles/proposal-program.contract.yml`
- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/tests/`

## Affected Artifact Coverage

The packet includes manifest, architecture proposal, README, target architecture, implementation plan, acceptance criteria, validation plan, source lineage, artifact catalog, and source-of-truth map.

## Validator Coverage

- `test-targeted-proposal-freshness.sh`
- `validate-proposal-lifecycle-terminal-freshness.sh --proposal <fixture> --targeted`
- `generate-proposal-registry.sh --check`

## Implementation Prompt Readiness

Ready for later generation of a child executable implementation prompt after review acceptance.

## Exclusions

No durable implementation, generated output refresh, archive, cleanup, delivery, branch mutation, PR fallback, protected evidence deletion, or `cleaned` claim is authorized by this packet.

## Final Route Recommendation

Run child proposal review and strict pre-integration architecture review before implementation prompt generation.
