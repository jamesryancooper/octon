# Implementation Plan

## Durable Promotion Targets

- `.octon/framework/cognition/_meta/architecture/`
- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/spec/`
- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/scripts/`
- `.octon/framework/assurance/runtime/_ops/tests/`

## Workstream

1. Generate advisory path authority class map: framework, instance, state/control, state/evidence, generated/read-model, inputs/proposal.
2. Map promotion targets and child write scopes to validators, owners, rollback surfaces, and dependent routes.
3. Fail closed if stale graph is used as if it were authority.
4. Use graph slices in proposal child context packs.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add or update schema/spec definitions for the proposed artifacts.
2. Add deterministic producer or wrapper code under the declared runtime/assurance surfaces.
3. Add reader preference so lifecycle planner, recovery, closeout, or executor uses compact artifacts by default.
4. Retain raw/full evidence unchanged and link compact artifacts by digest.
5. Add fail-closed stale/missing/digest-mismatch behavior.
6. Add validation fixtures and negative controls.
7. Update documentation or lifecycle contracts only where durable and non-proposal.
8. Run proposal and runtime validation.
9. Emit implementation conformance and drift/churn receipts before closeout.

## Validators

- repo authority graph source digest test
- target-family boundary validation
- stale graph fail-closed negative control
- promotion-target/write-scope index coverage test

## Evidence To Retain

- source refs and digests;
- compact artifact output;
- raw/full evidence refs;
- validator result manifest;
- token-budget ledger delta;
- route/model decision receipt when LLM is used;
- context-pack receipt and model-visible hash when consequential;
- rollback evidence.

## Closeout Refusal Criteria

Refuse successful closeout if compact artifacts cannot be verified against raw evidence, if generated/read-model state is stale, if authorization evidence is missing, if rollback evidence is missing, if raw/proposal/generated surfaces are treated as authority, or if child-owned receipts are incomplete.
