# Implementation Plan

_Status: Accepted child packet plan. Not implemented in this task._

## Profile Selection Receipt

- release_state: `pre-1.0`
- change_profile: `atomic`
- rationale: bounded proposal-packet slice with no hard gate requiring a
  transitional compatibility phase.

## Dependency Order

Dependencies: `proposal-program-runner-current-state-gap-map`, `proposal-program-runner-planning-replan-loop`.

## Workstreams

1. Reconfirm the current-state gap map and existing ownership before editing.
2. Update only declared write scopes needed for this child slice.
3. Preserve existing route, validator, workflow, publication, registry,
   cleanup, closeout, archive, disclosure-tier, and run-control ownership.
4. Add focused tests and negative fixtures for the acceptance criteria below.
5. Regenerate generated or registry state only through canonical scripts when
   authored sources require it.
6. Record implementation, conformance, post-implementation drift/churn, and
   validation evidence before promotion, closeout, or archive is considered.

## Write Scopes

- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/crates/lifecycle_executor/src`
- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/crates/lifecycle_executor/tests/`
- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/crates/kernel/src/lifecycle_program.rs`
- `.octon/framework/engine/runtime/adapters/`
- `.octon/inputs/additive/extensions/octon-proposal-lifecycle/context/lifecycles/proposal-program.contract.yml`

## Validation Plan

- Adapter tests cover `--execute-routes` delegation for parent routes and child batches.
- Negative tests prove missing delegation proof, invalid authority zone evidence, and route-declared human-only boundaries fail closed.
- Tests cover repo-local launcher guidance when the packaged `octon` binary lacks lifecycle support.

## Rollback

Use `git-revert` rollback. Do not rely on proposal-local files as runtime
truth. If generated outputs drift, regenerate them through canonical publisher
scripts or revert the authored-source change.
